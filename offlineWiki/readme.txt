About:

Offline wiki allows you to catalog Wikipedia articles on your
hard drive and filter through them.

How to use:

The reader allows you to read wikipedia articles downloaded as
txt files stored locally. The scraper allows you to enter a wikipedia
link and download it. Additionally, the scraping depth option
allows you to scrape all articles mentioned by the first one, and
all those mentioned by those (to infinity).

Required folder structure:

| | article 1.txt
| | article 2.txt
